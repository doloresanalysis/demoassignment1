    <p>Student No.: s3807452</p>

    <p>Background: I was born in Seoul, South Korea, and came to Australia with my parents when I was about 2 years old. 
                 I graduated from Chatswood High School in 2013 and have been bouncing between different degrees ever
                 since. I speak Korean with my parents but I'm actually more comfortable speaking English.</p>
    <p>Interesting Fact: I have a pet Samoyed (2.5 years old) and she was named after the Roman moon goddess, Luna. At the
                 the time I was looking for a male puppy and was considering naming him "Ghost" after Jon Snow's direwolf
                 from the Game of Thrones series. I was probably fortunate the breeder only had females available, because
                 now that I think about it... I don't think Ghost was a great name.</p>

  <!-- Interest in IT -->
  <div class="w3-container" id="services" style="margin-top:75px">
    <h1 class="w3-xxxlarge w3-text-red"><b>Interest in IT</b></h1>
    <hr style="width:50px;border:5px solid red" class="w3-round">
    <p><b>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that
      sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).</b></p>
    <p>Ever since I've laid my hands on a computer, I've had an ongoing interest in IT. From massive computers to pocket
    sized smartphones today, it is a testament to the impressive development of technology throughout the ages. What
    technology has achieved and what it can accomplish is truly limitless, and an opportunity for me to learn and 
    potentially contribute to its development is inspirational and exciting.</p>
    <p>Like most kids with computers, it was all about games. As I grew up, I played an RTS game called Warcraft III, and it had an editor that allowed you to create your own custom maps. This gave the opportunity for some people to create custom games that had abstract concepts, such as those borrowed from films, historical events, and even anime.
    </p>
    <p>Playing custom games that were fun and had elements from my favourite anime, inspired me to make my own custom map. Creating them involved writing your own code and handling all sorts of modules. My amateur attempt was unsuccessful but marked the beginning of experimenting with various other IT-related fields. For instance, I’ve played around with multimedia programs (creating videos), graphics editors (designing website banners), and even uploading videos on YouTube.
    </p>
    <p><b>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</b></p>
    <p>I’ve chosen to study at RMIT to finally embark on my journey in a career in IT. The online course made it very accessible and flexible, and I haven’t had the best experience in studying on campus. The alternative of self-study through online courses, bootcamps, etc. definitely has its advantages, but I wanted a bit more structure to my education. I can also always self-study on the side as well.
    </p>
    <p><b>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</b></p>
    <p>I’m expecting to lay down strong foundations for my IT studies - learning basic programming skills, understanding the broader IT landscape, and adapting to working online with a team. I’m also learning the differences between studying online and on campus as I’ve never done an online course before. By meeting with all sorts of people online, I’m also learning to interact with them through various platforms. Not only will studying at RMIT expand my knowledge base but teach me valuable skills that I can apply to the workplace in IT.

  <!-- Ideal Job -->
  <div class="w3-container" id="designers" style="margin-top:75px">
    <h1 class="w3-xxxlarge w3-text-red"><b>Ideal Job</b></h1>
    <hr style="width:50px;border:5px solid red" class="w3-round">
    <p><b>Job Description and particularly what makes this position appealing to you.</p>
    <p>Research Scientist</p>
    <p>DeepMind Research Scientists seek to build Artificial General Intelligence; AI that is capable of performing the same intellectual tasks as humans.They are required to continuously research and find ways for AI to have practical benefits to the world. For instance, Uber is undertaking research to have self-driving cars and these autonomous vehicles will need exceptional perceptual processing for it to anticipate and avoid various conditions on the road.
    </p>
    <p>Research Scientists will need to plan, create, and evaluate different models and software prototypes for this to be successful. Therefore, they will be working in teams and collaborating with a range of experts in fields such as software engineering, robotics, and neuroscience.
    </p>
    <p>The position is particularly appealing because it’s at the forefront of AI development, and since it’s a relatively new form of technology, history is being written. I’m an ambitious individual and this kind of pioneering research strikes a chord with me, because it gives you the opportunity to advance humanity with innovative technology. Thanks to Sci-Fi pop culture (i.e. The Terminator, The BladeRunner, etc), some may find the whole concept quite scary or even disturbing.
    </p>
    <p>Personally however, it presents a huge potential for us to improve our quality of life and further expand our knowledge of the unknown. To be able to contribute and to be part of the whole process will be an extremely fulfilling and rewarding experience.
    </p>
    <p><b>Skills, qualifications and experiences required for the position.</b></p>
    <p>Research Scientists are essentially experts in their field of study and will thus require many years of study and 
      practice. The position at DeepMind requires the following:</p>
    <p>- PhD in a technical field, such as machine learning, neuroscience, or computer science,</p>
    <p>- Strong history of publications at conferences or in journals,</p>
    <p>- Exceptional skill in software engineering, designing and implementing algorithms, and applying them to the real
      world,</p>
    <p>- Solid understanding of Google supported languages such as C++, Java, and Python,</p>
    <p>- Genuine passion for AI.</p> 
    <p>Sadly, I don't have any of the required skills, qualifications or experiences for the position yet, but I do have
      the passion and curiousity for AI and its development.</p>
    <p><b>A plan describing how you will obtain the skils, qualifcations and experiences required for the position, or building on those you have now.</b></p>
    <p>1. To finish my current course at RMIT (Bachelor of Information Technology) and/or,</p>
    <p>2. Transfer to a Bachelor of Computer Science, either abroad or in Australia,</p>
    <p>3. Obtain MSc in Computer Science - specialising in Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence,</p>
    <p>4. Obtain PhD in ML/AI.</p>
    <p>Although there are great PhD programs for ML/AI available in Australia, American Colleges typically rank the highest on their research in the field, with colleges such as Carnegie Mellon University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Stanford University.
    </p>
    <p>I will also need to consistently do my own research on the related topics and publish good papers at top tier conferences like the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), Artificial Intelligence Conference, and Machine Learning Innovation Summit. Additionally, I will need to maintain extremely high grade averages across my courses and also try to further expand my knowledge base and experience by undertaking internships at companies and universities.
