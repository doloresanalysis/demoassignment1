    <p>Background: I was born in Seoul, South Korea, and came to Australia with my parents when I was about 2 years old. 
                 I graduated from Chatswood High School in 2013 and have been bouncing between different degrees ever

    <p>Interesting Fact: I have a pet Samoyed (2.5 years old) and she was named after the Roman moon goddess, Luna. At the
                 the time I was looking for a male puppy and was considering naming him "Ghost" after Jon Snow's direwolf
                 from the Game of Thrones series. I was probably fortunate the breeder only had females available, because
                 now that I think about it... I don't think Ghost was a great name.</p>

  <!-- Interest in IT -->
  <div class="w3-container" id="services" style="margin-top:75px">
    <h1 class="w3-xxxlarge w3-text-red"><b>Interest in IT</b></h1>
    <hr style="width:50px;border:5px solid red" class="w3-round">
    <p><b>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that
      sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).</b></p>
    <p>Ever since I've laid my hands on a computer, I've had an ongoing interest in IT. From massive computers to pocket
    sized smartphones today, it is a testament to the impressive development of technology throughout the ages. What
    technology has achieved and what it can accomplish is truly limitless, and an opportunity for me to learn and 
    potentially contribute to its development is inspirational and exciting.</p>
    <p>Like most kids with computers, it was all about games. As I grew up, I played an RTS game called Warcraft III, and it had an editor that allowed you to create your own custom maps. This gave the opportunity for some people to create custom games that had abstract concepts, such as those borrowed from films, historical events, and even anime.
    </p>
    <p>Playing custom games that were fun and had elements from my favourite anime, inspired me to make my own custom map. Creating them involved writing your own code and handling all sorts of modules. My amateur attempt was unsuccessful but marked the beginning of experimenting with various other IT-related fields. For instance, I’ve played around with multimedia programs (creating videos), graphics editors (designing website banners), and even uploading videos on YouTube.
    </p>
    <p><b>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</b></p>
    <p>I’ve chosen to study at RMIT to finally embark on my journey in a career in IT. The online course made it very accessible and flexible, and I haven’t had the best experience in studying on campus. The alternative of self-study through online courses, bootcamps, etc. definitely has its advantages, but I wanted a bit more structure to my education. I can also always self-study on the side as well.
    </p>
    <p><b>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</b></p>
    <p>I’m expecting to lay down strong foundations for my IT studies - learning basic programming skills, understanding the broader IT landscape, and adapting to working online with a team. I’m also learning the differences between studying online and on campus as I’ve never done an online course before. By meeting with all sorts of people online, I’m also learning to interact with them through various platforms. Not only will studying at RMIT expand my knowledge base but teach me valuable skills that I can apply to the workplace in IT.

  <!-- Ideal Job -->
  <div class="w3-container" id="designers" style="margin-top:75px">
    <h1 class="w3-xxxlarge w3-text-red"><b>Ideal Job</b></h1>
    <hr style="width:50px;border:5px solid red" class="w3-round">
    <p><b>Job Description and particularly what makes this position appealing to you.</b></p>
    <p>Research Scientist</p>
    <p>DeepMind Research Scientists seek to build Artificial General Intelligence; AI that is capable of performing the same intellectual tasks as humans.They are required to continuously research and find ways for AI to have practical benefits to the world. For instance, Uber is undertaking research to have self-driving cars and these autonomous vehicles will need exceptional perceptual processing for it to anticipate and avoid various conditions on the road.
    </p>
    <p>Research Scientists will need to plan, create, and evaluate different models and software prototypes for this to be successful. Therefore, they will be working in teams and collaborating with a range of experts in fields such as software engineering, robotics, and neuroscience.
    </p>
    <p>The position is particularly appealing because it’s at the forefront of AI development, and since it’s a relatively new form of technology, history is being written. I’m an ambitious individual and this kind of pioneering research strikes a chord with me, because it gives you the opportunity to advance humanity with innovative technology. Thanks to Sci-Fi pop culture (i.e. The Terminator, The BladeRunner, etc), some may find the whole concept quite scary or even disturbing.
    </p>
    <p>Personally however, it presents a huge potential for us to improve our quality of life and further expand our knowledge of the unknown. To be able to contribute and to be part of the whole process will be an extremely fulfilling and rewarding experience.
    </p>
    <p><b>Skills, qualifications and experiences required for the position.</b></p>
    <p>Research Scientists are essentially experts in their field of study and will thus require many years of study and 
      practice. The position at DeepMind requires the following:</p>
    <p>- PhD in a technical field, such as machine learning, neuroscience, or computer science,</p>
    <p>- Strong history of publications at conferences or in journals,</p>
    <p>- Exceptional skill in software engineering, designing and implementing algorithms, and applying them to the real
      world,</p>
    <p>- Solid understanding of Google supported languages such as C++, Java, and Python,</p>
    <p>- Genuine passion for AI.</p> 
    <p>Sadly, I don't have any of the required skills, qualifications or experiences for the position yet, but I do have
      the passion and curiousity for AI and its development.</p>
    <p><b>A plan describing how you will obtain the skils, qualifcations and experiences required for the position, or building on those you have now.</b></p>
    <p>1. To finish my current course at RMIT (Bachelor of Information Technology) and/or,</p>
    <p>2. Transfer to a Bachelor of Computer Science, either abroad or in Australia,</p>
    <p>3. Obtain MSc in Computer Science - specialising in Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence,</p>
    <p>4. Obtain PhD in ML/AI.</p>
    <p>Although there are great PhD programs for ML/AI available in Australia, American Colleges typically rank the highest on their research in the field, with colleges such as Carnegie Mellon University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Stanford University.
    </p>
    <p>I will also need to consistently do my own research on the related topics and publish good papers at top tier conferences like the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), Artificial Intelligence Conference, and Machine Learning Innovation Summit. Additionally, I will need to maintain extremely high grade averages across my courses and also try to further expand my knowledge base and experience by undertaking internships at companies and universities.

  <!-- Personality Profile -->
  <div class="w3-container" id="packages" style="margin-top:75px">
    <h1 class="w3-xxxlarge w3-text-red"><b>Personality Profile</b></h1>
    <hr style="width:50px;border:5px solid red" class="w3-round">
    <p><b>Myers-Briggs Test</b></p>
    <p>According to a Myers-Briggs test I took on Truity, my personality types are:</p>
    <p>- INFG (the Counselor): <b>I</b>ntroverted, i<b>N</b>tuitive, <b>F</b>eeling, and <b>J</b>udging.</p>
    <p>- INTJ (the Mastermind): <b>I</b>ntroverted, i<b>N</b>tuitive, <b>T</b>hinking, and <b>J</b>udging.</p>
    <p>INFJs and INTJs enjoy spending time alone and like to think about idealistic concepts, as opposed to focusing on minute details. Both personality types are mostly similar since they share three of the four primary traits. However, the difference appears in the decision-making process. INFJs makes decisions based on emotions while INTJs makes them based on logical reasoning.
    </p>
    <p><b>Learning Style Test</b></p>
    <p>My results from a learning style test from educationplanner.org show:</p>
    <p>- 40% Auditory</p>
    <p>- 35% Visual</p>
    <p>- 25% Tactile</p>
    <p>The results indicate I’m primarily an auditory and visual learner. This means that I learn most effectively by listening to and seeing material. For example, I will be able to absorb information better by hearing the words from an instructor and looking at the manual, rather than doing the physical activities required.
    </p>
    <p><b>Big Five Personality Test</b></p>
    <p>On Truity’s Big Five Personality Test, I scored:</p>
    <p>- 83% in Openness
    <p>- 73% in Conscientiousness</p>
    <p>- 17% in Extraversion</p>
    <p>- 69% in Agreeableness</p>
    <p>- 60% in Neuroticism</p>
    <p>83% in Openness suggests I’m highly creative, adventurous, and intellectual, and will strongly tend to have abstract, complex thoughts. 73% in Conscientiousness indicate I’m diligent and self-disciplined in pursuing my goals, and prepared to make sacrifices in the present for the future. 17% in Extraversion shows I’m an introvert that doesn’t actively seek attention and perfectly content with a simple and quiet life. 69% in Agreeableness describes my tendency to place the needs of others above my own, and to be more cooperative than competitive. 60% in Neuroticism reveals my susceptibility to negative emotions, such as anxiety, guilt, and shame.
    </p>
    <p><b>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</b></p>
    <p>The results of these tests have confirmed and clarified some aspects about myself, and even revealed some surprising things. My strengths and weaknesses have been identified, and therefore shown me what I need to personally work on and what qualities I should play on. For example, I’ve scored 60% in Neuroticism which indicates I’m more prone to feeling negative emotions. Knowing this, I can look for personal strategies to help me overcome or mitigate them.
    </p>
    <p>Some test results were surprising, especially finding myself to be primarily an auditory learner. Discovering these results have motivated me to use more auditory resources such as podcasts, audiobooks, etc. Overall I found out more about myself through these tests and it has given me an opportunity to improve my character and personal qualities.
    </p>
    <p><b>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</b></p>
    <p>The test results have allowed me to learn about myself in greater depth, and now I can use this knowledge to better utilise my core values. For instance, I scored highly in Conscientiousness that translates to good organisation and impulse control. Therefore, I can take upon a management type role in the team that helps keep updates on everyone’s progress. Additionally, the learning style test result has suggested I’m mainly an auditory learner so I’ll be more open to communicating with the team via voice chat applications, such as Discord, Skype, TeamSpeak, etc.
    </p>
    <p><b>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</b></p>
    <p>Based on the results of the tests I’ve taken, I would take a selective approach in forming a team with people with personalities that are compatible with mine. In the Big Five Personality test, I scored highly on ‘Agreeableness’ and would thus try to find other individuals with a strong tendency to be agreeable. It will be ideal because cooperative team members means less friction in the team environment, particularly in decision-making and brainstorming ideas.
    </p>
    <p>On the other hand, individuals who score low in Agreeableness tend to assert their own opinions, go against the grain, and unwillingly go along with team decisions. In conclusion, online personality test results effectively help you form teams with better chemistry because each member is more compatible with each other, ultimately yielding increased team performance and satisfaction.</p>

  <!-- Project Idea -->
  <div class="w3-container" id="contact" style="margin-top:75px">
    <h1 class="w3-xxxlarge w3-text-red"><b>Project Idea</b></h1>
    <hr style="width:50px;border:5px solid red" class="w3-round">
    <p><b>Overview</b></p>
    <p>Inspired by the efforts of wildlife conservationists, park rangers, and animal rights activists. Sentinel is an AI drone surveillance network that will help combat poaching, further study animals, and promote animal rights. The drones will be programmed with AI to help identify poaching behaviour in national parks and track criminal activity. The project’s success will help protect countless animals from poachers and the black market, as well as further our study of animal behaviour. The main challenges for this project is the cost efficiency, drone battery life, and effective algorithm in identifying poaching behaviour. 
    </p>
    <p><b>Motivation</b></p>
    <p>Drones have a variety of uses in the real world, from being used to photograph scenic views to even being trialled to patrol national borders. From an educational perspective, we have yet to fully understand animal behaviour and their migration patterns, and the use of drones will help us learn more. A statistic by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) reported rhino poaching in South Africa increased from 13 to 1004 between 2007 to 2013 - an increase of 7700%. As a result, some species of rhinos are critically endangered and risk being extinct. This is only an example of one animal out of numerous in danger of being wiped out. Although the efforts made today to prevent and tackle poaching are admirable, it is not enough. Drones can be the answer to help put an end to poaching.

      <p>Sentinel is an AI drone surveillance network that will help combat poaching, further the study of animals, and promote animal rights. The project was inspired by the efforts of wildlife conservationists and park rangers around the globe, and will provide an invaluable tool to them if the project comes to fruition. The drones will be programmed with an AI algorithm that will identify poaching behaviour in national parks and track criminal activity. The project’s main challenges arise from cost efficiency, drone production, and developing an algorithm that will be effective and reliable.</p>
      <p>Drones have a variety of uses out in the real world; from being used to photograph scenic views to patrol national borders. A statistic by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) reported rhino poaching in South Africa increased from 13 to 1004 between 2007 to 2013 - an increase of 7700%. Consequently some rhino species are critically endangered, and this is only one example of the many species of animals that are in danger of being extinct. Although admirable efforts are being made by concerned stakeholders, it is simply not enough. Drones can be the answer to finally put an end to poaching.</p>
      <p><b>Speed & Flight Action</b></p>
      <p>Currently, we rely on park rangers to patrol national parks to deter poachers but they need to cover huge areas: the Kruger National Park in South Africa is 19,485 square kilometres. Therefore, it’s not feasible for them to patrol by foot/vehicle and drones can provide an effective alternative since they can cover a lot of ground in a short amount of time. High-end consumer-grade drones can fly up to about 80 km/h and can only be in the air for about 25 minutes. To improve these technical limitations, Sentinel will use combustion engines which will allow them to fly faster, longer, and even carry more weight. These drones will have better manoeuvrability than ground patrols as they’re in the air and can bypass obstructions from terrains and roaming animals.</p>
      <p><b>Infrared/Thermal Camera</b></p>
      <p>Additionally, drones will be equipped with powerful infrared/thermal cameras that can detect heat signatures from people, animals, and gunfire. Since drones can detect heat signatures from animals, it can help us learn about animal behaviour by understanding their migratory patterns more closely and accurately. Experts today still don’t fully understand elephants and their reasoning for migrating to certain locations and drone surveillance can provide valuable data.</p>
      <p><b>AI Algorithm</b></p> 
      <p>Along with an AI algorithm with multiple functions, such as poaching identification, ‘lock and track’ function, and silent alarm system, we can effectively deal with poachers and further undermine black markets. Drones will be equipped with powerful cameras that can allow them to visually recognise poaching behaviour, i.e. shooting rifle postures, handling an animal’s carcass, etc. The algorithm will then trigger a silent alarm system alerting nearby park rangers and law enforcement agencies. Afterwards, the drones will be “locked” onto the target and then continually follow the poachers so they can be either arrested or tracked until more criminal accomplices can be caught.</p>
      <p><b>Commercial Purposes</b></p>
      <p>The drones’ highly sophisticated functions can also be used for personal and commercial purposes. The national park can offer a paid service to photograph, film and study animals and the surrounding scenery. This can be quite useful to photographers, cinematographers and wildlife experts who may not have access to such high end equipment. As a result, the drones program will be generating an additional source of income for the national park which can further fund the project, national park facilities and wildlife conservation efforts, justifying their use.</p>
      <p>Overall, the drones have a variety of uses that can benefit a range of stakeholders such as animal experts, wildlife conservationists, and the wider community so they can enjoy the prolonged conservation of some species.</p>
      <p><b>Tools and Technologies</b></p>
      <p>The drone model will be based on a quadcopter and use a combustion engine. A combustion engine will be used rather than conventional batteries because the former can improve the speed up to 100 km/h in comparison to battery-powered drones reaching around 80 km/h. Combustion engines also allow drones to stay significantly longer in the air than batteries: 60 minutes versus 25 minutes. Additionally, they can carry heavier loads of up to 5 kg which will be useful for equipping the drone with a thermal and high-end camera and other hardware.</p>
      <p>The drone will be programmed with an AI algorithm that can recognise poaching behaviour, with certain postures such as aiming a rifle, sawing motion, etc. to trigger different levels of suspicion. Upon reaching higher levels of suspicion, the drone will proceed to closely inspect the situation so it can verify the activity. Using a GPS, the drone can then alert rangers and the police of the location (Silent Alarm System) and then “lock and track”.</p>
      <p><b>Skills Required</b></p>
      <p>Scientists from the University of Southern California have already developed an algorithm, called Systematic POacher deTector (SPOT), that can differentiate poachers from animals in three-tenths of a second. The next step would be to design an algorithm that can accurately and quickly recognise poaching behaviour which can be very complicated. For instance, the AI will need to be able to tell the difference between an individual holding a rifle and a camera, analysing the posture and body positioning. Time of day can influence the probability of poaching as poachers normally operate at night to avoid watchful eyes from tourists and rangers. We have the necessary hardware available and in reach of the software needed, therefore Sentinel is a feasible and viable project.</p>
      <p><b>Outcome</b></p>
      <p>The project’s success will effectively deter, prevent and tackle the increasingly problematic issue of poaching. We will be preserving our precious and fragile ecosystems by protecting endangered species, and will be supporting wildlife education by providing more data for experts and students to interpret and analyse. It will also give an opportunity for photographers and cinematographers to take pictures and film beautiful sceneries that may have not been possible before. By providing a stream of income by offering these services, the program can be self-funded to a certain extent and support the national park and wildlife conservation efforts. In conclusion, the project coming to light has a multitude of benefits to the many stakeholders that can justify the high costs of such an ambitious project.</p>
